   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Go to the original repository on GitHub
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select your branch and provide a clear description
4. Wait for review and address any feedback

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Rules

- Use TypeScript for new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Write meaningful variable and function names

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Keep components small and focused

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

- Use async/await instead of callbacks
- Implement proper error handling
- Add input validation
- Follow RESTful API conventions

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Test both frontend and backend changes
- Include edge cases in your tests

## Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Update API documentation
- Include examples in your documentation

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, Node.js version, etc.)
- Screenshots if applicable

## Feature Requests

For new features:

- Check if the feature already exists
- Describe the use case clearly
- Explain why it would be valuable
- Consider implementation complexity

## Code Review Process

All contributions go through code review:

1. Automated checks must pass
2. At least one maintainer review required
3. Address all feedback before merging
4. Squash commits if requested

## Release Process

- Features are merged to `main` branch
- Releases are tagged with semantic versioning
- Changelog is updated for each release
